# Gonja

`gonja` is a pure `go` implementation of the [Jinja template engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/). It aims to be _mostly_ compatible with the original `python` implementation but also provides additional features to compensate the lack of `python` scripting capabilities.

## Usage

### As a library

Install/update using `go get`:
```
go get github.com/nikolalohinski/gonja
```

### As a `terraform` provider

This `gonja` library has been packaged as a `terraform` provider. For more information, please refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/NikolaLohinski/jinja/latest/docs).

## Example

```golang
import (
	"github.com/nikolalohinski/gonja"
)

func main() {
    tpl, err := gonja.FromString("Hello {{ name | capitalize }}!")
    if err != nil {
    	panic(err)
    }
    out, err := tpl.Execute(gonja.Context{"name": "bob"})
    if err != nil {
    	panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(out) // Prints: Hello Bob!
}
```

## Documentation

* For a details on how the template language works, please refer to [the Jinja documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) ;
* `gonja` API documentation is available on [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/nikolalohinski/gonja) ;
* `filters`: please refer to [`docs/filters.md`](docs/filters.md) ;
* `statements`: please take a look at [`docs/statements.md`](docs/statments.md) ;
* `tests`: please see [`docs/tests.md`](docs/tests.md) ;
* `globals`: please browse through [`docs/globals.md`](docs/globals.md).

## Known caveats 

**NOTE**: Pull requests are welcomed to fix any of the following issues. Any help will be very much appreciated üôè

### Filters

* **format**: `format` does **not** take Python's string format syntax as a parameter, instead it takes Go's. Essentially `{{ 3.14|stringformat:"pi is %.2f" }}` is `fmt.Sprintf("pi is %.2f", 3.14)`.
* **escape** / **force_escape**: Unlike Jinja's behavior, the `escape`-filter is applied immediately. Therefore there is no need for a `force_escape`-filter yet.

### Code hanging

Leaving a string open as such:
```
{{ "test }}
```
Can lead the library to hang forever.
